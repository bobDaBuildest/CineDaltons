Suggested KPIs to Implement
The following are provided as examples of KPIs that the team could choose to implement:

Audience Engagement Score

Star Power Index

Awards Potential

Box Office Popularity Proxy

 General Interpretation of the Suggested KPIs
While the project itself does not define the calculation method for these specific cinematic KPIs, here is a general idea of what they typically measure in the context of film:

Suggested KPI	Potential Metric Focus
Audience Engagement Score	Measures the level of user/audience interaction. This could be calculated based on user ratings, comments,
number of times a movie is added to a watchlist, or participation in the Quiz/Trivia game.
Star Power Index	Measures the commercial influence of an actor or director. This could be based on the cumulative box office revenue of their previous
films or their general popularity/notoriety over time.
Awards Potential	An indicator of how likely a film, actor, or director is to receive industry recognition.
This might involve factors like critical review scores, film festival nominations/wins, or the presence of a notable director/cast.
Box Office Popularity Proxy	A measure that estimates or proxies box office success using publicly available data 
(since actual box office data might be proprietary), such as popularity scores from The Movie Database (TMDb).
Other Project-Related Metrics
In addition to the cinematic KPIs required for the application's functionality, the project will also be evaluated based on development process metrics:

Agile/Scrum Metrics: The team needs to track progress through sprints and user stories.

The number of user stories initially planned with points versus the number ultimately implemented.

How the completion of a user story is certified (e.g., passing tests).

Quality & Process Metrics (CI/CD): The overall quality of the development process is a key factor in the assessment.

Quality of the code, confirmed by a sufficient number of code checks/tests.

Use and quality of the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).

Testing coverage and success rate.
