The project description mandates the inclusion of several advanced **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and intelligent features for the CineMatch application.

The required and suggested AI integrations are crucial components of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and are specifically mentioned in the project plan.

Required AI Features

| Feature | Description | Tools Mentioned |
| **Sentiment Analysis and Recommendations** | Analyzing the sentiment (e.g., positive, negative) in movie descriptions or user reviews. This is then used to
suggest related movies that have a similar "sentiment". | Hugging Face models 
| **"Who Are You?" Actor Lookalike Game** |A feature where the user can upload a photo, and the application uses AI models to determine which
actor the user resembles. | Luxand API or Hugging Face models 
| **Intelligent KPI Calculation** | The platform must enrich open data (like TMDb) with "intelligent functions" to calculate unique statistical metrics (KPIs) 
for movies, actors, and directors. | AI models (Implicitly used to enrich data) 
| **Quiz/Trivia Question Generation** | The questions for the movie Quiz/Trivia game can be generated automatically, potentially using the assistance of
AI models. | AI models (e.g., Hugging Face) 

Required Technologies

The project specifically identifies the following external AI services for integration:

* **Hugging Face Inference API**
    * This API is a prime candidate for the **Sentiment Analysis** and **Quiz Question Generation** tasks, as Hugging Face hosts many models suited for text
classification and generation (NLP).
* **Luxand API**
    * This API offers facial recognition and comparison services, making it a suitable tool for the **"Who Are You?" Actor Lookalike Game**.
* **Other open REST APIs**
    Movie Database (TMDB)
    Open Movie Database (OMDb) API
