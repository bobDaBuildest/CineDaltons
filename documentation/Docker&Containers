Docker is a platform for building and running containers, which are lightweight, isolated environments that package an application with all its dependencies
Containers are like standardized, portable executables that share the host operating system's kernel, making them more efficient than traditional virtual 
machines that virtualize an entire computer and OS.

IN SIMPLE TERMS:

Imagine you have a recipe (the image) and you want to cook it (create a container). 
Docker allows you to package the ingredients and instructions into a portable container, 
ensuring that the dish (application) will always be cooked the same way, regardless of where you're cooking it.
